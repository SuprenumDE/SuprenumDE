# Welcome to SuprenumDE

**SuprenumDE, the GitHub repository for data analysis and machine learning with the statistical environment  R and C++.**

C++ is used to enable high-performance machine learning without the need for *oversized frameworks* such as *TensorFlow*. Based on the principle of “use the right tool for the work to be done!”

This means that *R* is used for the data preparation steps and the subsequent training analysis. The training of the neural network/deep learning structure is handled by a *lean and high-performance C++ program*.

The interface between R and the C++ program is deliberately kept simple and universal. Universal as a keyword: Of course, the C++ program can also be accessed via other environments such as Python. 

The first C++ program is [**Dense_NN**](https://github.com/SuprenumDE/Dense_NN), which can be used to train dense-type deep learning networks. Just take a look at the [**EigenNET**](https://github.com/SuprenumDE/EigenNET) repository! It describes an example workflow R-> Dense_NN -> R.
